				If you are like most people, you don’t often think about lobsters
				2—unless you’re eating one. However, these interesting and delicious
				crustaceans are very much worth considering. Their nervous systems are
				comparatively simple, with large, easily observable neurons, the magic
				cells of the brain. Because of this, scientists have been able to map
				the neural circuitry of lobsters very accurately. This has helped us
				understand the structure and function of the brain and behaviour of more
				complex animals, including human beings. Lobsters have more in common
				with you than you might think (particularly when you are feeling
				crabby—ha ha).
